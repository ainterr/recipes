# Recipes

A collection of recipes that I don't want to lose. Hosted on [GitHub
Pages](https://ainterr.dev/recipes).

## Installation

Dependencies and build scripts can be installed with
[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the development server:


```bash
npm start
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Recipes are compiled using a pre-build script - to refresh the recipe list,
> you need to restart the Angular development server each time you make
> changes. This may change in the future.
