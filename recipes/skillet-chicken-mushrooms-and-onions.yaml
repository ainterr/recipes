instructions:
  - In a large mixing bowl, combine about 2 tbsp olive oil, red wine vinegar,
    honey, mustard, and red pepper flakes to taste. Cut chicken thighs into
    medium strips, season with salt and pepper, then add to the marinade. Set
    aside at room temperature.
  - Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until very hot. Add onions
    without any cooking oil. Season with salt and cook mostly undisturbed for 4
    minutes. Add mushrooms and season with more salt. Cook until the mushrooms
    lose their water, about 4 minutes more.
  - Push the onions and mushrooms to the edge of the skillet and add chicken
    pieces to the center. Pour remaining marinade over the onions and
    mushrooms. Brown the chicken, then stir to combine. Continue cooking until
    chicken is cooked through.
  - Add another splash of vinegar and deglaze. Remove from the heat and add
    parsley and parmesan, tossing to combine.
notes:
  - Serve with butter noodles or crusty bread.
