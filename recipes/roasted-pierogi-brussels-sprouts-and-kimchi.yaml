  - Add pierogi to the pan and drizzle again with olive oil. Roast for another
    20-25 minutes, until pierogi are golden and puffed.
  - While roasting, prepare the dill sauce - combine sour cream, dill, lemon
    juice, about 1 tbsp olive oil, and salt to taste.
  - Serve pierogi, brussels, and kimchi over a generous bed of sauce, drizzle
    with a little more olive oil, and garnish with fresh dill.
notes:
  - There is no need to pre-cook the pierogi - add them directly to the sheet
    pan from the package or from frozen.
  - Gnocchi can be substituted for pierogi - add to the sheet pan straight from
    the package or from frozen.
  - If using homemade pierogi, boil first, but no need to pan fry.
