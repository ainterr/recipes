  - group: Dough
    instructions:
    - Whisk flour and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.
    - Heat 1 cup water and butter together until butter is melted.
    - Gradually add the butter mixture to the flour mixture, stirring - the
      dough will resemble a rough biscuit dough.
    - Stir in the eggs until combined.
    - Transfer to a floured work surface and knead 5-7 minutes.
    - Cover dough and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
  - group: Filling
    instructions:
    - In a medium pot, cover diced potatoes with water, salt and bring to a
      simmer. Cook until tender, about 25 minutes.
    - In a large skillet, brown the onions and mushrooms.
    - Drain the cooked potatoes, add to a large bowl with the onions and
      mushrooms, and mix together with the sour cream. Salt to taste.
  - group: Pierogi
    instructions:
    - Form the wrappers - cut the dough into four pieces, keeping the remaining
      dough covered while you work. Roll out the dough to 1/8 inch and cut with
      a 3 inch biscuit cutter or a glass. 1/4 of the dough should yield about
      12-15 wrappers.
    - Form the pierogi - wet the outer edge of a wrapper, spoon a small
      tablespoon into the middle, fold in half, pinching together in the middle
      and work downward with both hands to seal the pierogi. Try to avoid air
      bubbles and make sure that the dough seals nicely. Transfer to a floured
      baking sheet.
    - Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

    instructions:
    - Bring a large pot of water to boil. Salt.
    - Boil the pierogi in batches to avoid crowding the pot. Cook until they
      start to rise to the surface and then another minute or so, about 3-4
      minutes total.
    - Optionally, pan fry the pierogi in butter after boiling, 1-2 minutes per
      side.
notes:
  - Peirogi can be frozen after forming and before cooking and cooked later
    directly from frozen.
yield: 48-60 pierogi
