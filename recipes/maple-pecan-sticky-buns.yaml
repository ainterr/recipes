instructions:
  - Combine the yeast, buttermilk and 1 tablespoon sugar, and let sit until
    foamy, about 5 minutes.
  - To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the flour, salt
    and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Stir to combine, then add the butter and
    toss to coat in the flour. Add the eggs and buttermilk mixture, then mix on
    low to combine, about 1 or 2 minutes.
  - Increase speed to medium, and mix the dough until it is soft, billowy and
    clearing the sides of the bowl, but still sticking to the bottom, 8 to 10
    minutes. If the dough seems very, very soft and still sticks to the sides
    of the bowl, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time (up to about 4
    tablespoons).
  - Lightly grease a separate large bowl with butter and transfer the dough to
    it. Turn the dough to coat with butter, then cover the bowl with a kitchen
    towel. Let the dough rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size,
    about 1 hour, then refrigerate the dough for 1 hour more.
  - In a medium saucepan (to prevent boiling over), combine the maple syrup,
    brown sugar, butter and salt. Bring to a boil over medium and cook for 1
    minute. The mixture will thicken slightly. Pour the mixture into a metal
    9-by-13-inch baking pan and tilt the pan to evenly cover the bottom with
    the syrup.  Sprinkle the pecans evenly over the top, and set aside.
  - In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom and salt.
  - Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and pat or roll it into a
    12-by-16-inch rectangle that’s ¼-inch thick. Gently spread the softened
    butter over the dough, leaving about 1 inch of unbuttered dough on the long
    edge furthest from you. Sprinkle the sugar mixture evenly over the top of
    the butter. From the long end closest to you, roll the dough into a tight
    log. With the seam side down, use a serrated knife or length of floss to
    cut the log into 12 even pieces.
  - Place the rolls spiral side up into the prepared pan, cover and let rise
    until puffy but not quite doubled in size, about 45 minutes. (This may take
    a little longer if you refrigerated the dough for longer than 1 hour after
    the first rise.) If you’d like to bake them later, you can refrigerate the
    rolls in the pan before this second rise for up to 24 hours. Let the rolls
    rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size before baking. They
    will take longer to rise after chilling, depending on the ambient
    temperature.
  - Heat oven to 350 degrees and bake rolls for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the
    rolls are golden brown and the caramel is bubbling a bit around the edges.
    Carefully run an offset spatula or thin knife around the edges of the pan.
    Let the rolls cool in the pan on a rack for about 5 minutes, then flip them
    out onto a serving tray or sheet pan. Let cool for a minute or two, then
    enjoy warm.
notes:
  - Can be made a day ahead up to the final rise and left to sit in the fridge
    overnight.
yield: 12 buns.
