      - name: onion

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 250°F.
  - In a large dutch oven over medium heat, add oil, onion, carrot, and celery.
    Cook, moving occasionally, until browned slightly then add garlic and allow
    that to brown as well - about 5 minutes total.
  - Add red chile sauce, chicken, and chicken stock. Stir to combine, bring
    to a low simmer, and then immediately transfer to the oven, covered.
  - Braise in the oven, covered for 3-4 hours. Check every hour.
  - When the chicken shreds easily with a fork and the soup is rich and
    flavorful, transfer dutch oven to a stove top over medium-low heat. Remove
    vegetables and chicken, discarding the vegetables.
  - Add hominy to the broth and let it simmer while shredding the chicken,
    discarding the bones and skin. Return shredded chicken to the pot and
    continue with a low simmer for another 20-30 minutes.
  - Serve and garnish with lime juice, cilantro, onion, or crushed tortilla
    chips as desired.
notes:
  - The red chile sauce really decides the flavor and character of the posole.
    For a classic, comforting New Mexican version use a sauce of primarily
    Anaheim chiles with a lot of garlic. For a more Oaxacan version try a blend
    of Guajillo, Ancho, and Arbol.
  - For a lighter posole, remove skin from half of the chicken thighs before
    cooking.
  - The hominy can be left to soak the night before and made ahead, but should
    be made from dried - the texture and flavor are significantly better than
    canned.
